    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ramen are thin, <em>yellow noodles</em> made from wheat and typically served in a flavorful hot broth. Kansui (alkaline water) gives ramen noodles their unique, springy texture and yellow color. Ramen originated in China, but it became very popular in Japan, particularly after World War II, when Ramen’s popularity rose above other Japanese noodles such as soba and udon.</p>
